# C/C++ programs that Integrate simple equations
#### I wish C/C++ could be rendered in <math>\LaTeX<\math> (or shall we do it?)

I'm learning to use $\sum_{a}^{b} f(x) \ \Delta x$ using my favorite programming language.
Also this is my first GitHub usage after downloading thousands of files from here without acknowledgment (spell what?). 

By the way the "better_with_scanf" one has a decent easter egg given you put things right (where the fun is spoiled if you just check the source code).
